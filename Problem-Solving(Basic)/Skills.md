Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into 
something a computer can do, and finally how to write the specific code to implement the solution. At its core, problem-solving focuses on the study, understanding, and 
usage of data structures and algorithms. 

This competency area includes basic Data Structures and Algorithms.

Key Competencies:

  **1.Basic Data Structures** - Use Data Structures such as Arrays and Strings. Traverse through arrays, strings, and linked lists. 
                              Access and update individual elements in arrays, and characters in strings.
                              
  **2.Basic Algorithms (such as Sorting and Searching)** - Create simple sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, counting sort. 
                                                          Create simple brute force and sub-optimal solutions.
