  //Algorithm Discussion on Problem 1

    /* The below problem solving algorithm approach is mine ; it's upto a programmer how efficiently they can optimize the solution. */

/*
  The first coding problem in my assessment test was about :
                                                            
                                                              Finding the average value of a list elements
    
                                                              I solved this problem using in-built function called as mean().*/
    
 // As this was 1st problem so they kept straight-forward Problem Statemets which I told earlier was based on finding avg. value of a list elements.
