//Algorithm Discussion on Problem 2

/* The below problem solving algorithm approach is mine ; it's upto a programmer how efficiently they can optimize the solution. */

/*
The second coding problem in my assessment test was about :
  
                                                            It was based on Oops concepts 
    
                                                            I need to implements remove,insert, update and delete userdefine functions for the given problem statements.
      
                                                            I have done this problem using the class and object Oops concepts.
        
                                                            As they already provided the usedefine functions name so coming to implementation part it was not too tough
                                                            to frame a required solution for the given problem statements.
                                                        
  A basic knowledge of python which gives you overview of all topics can successfully complete this certification .
